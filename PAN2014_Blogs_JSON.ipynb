      "<p>Partnering with external entities can be a difficult endeavor, even in those companies who espouse open innovation. Perhaps it is a fear of job security, change, compromising sensitive information to potential competitors, a disdain for ideas not developed in house or it may just be a lack of time, energy and information.  As research and development organizations are being pared down to more development and less research it is understandable that R&amp;D staff are just too focused on getting the next product, goods or service out the door, on time and within budget to navigate an external alliance.</p>\n",
      "<p>While these partnership endeavors are no ‘easy button’ to solving a current crises, there are certainly long-term tangible and intangible advantages for primary investigators and R&amp;D managers alike, who invest in external partnering. The tangible benefits include access to labs, equipment, materials, expertise, and future recruits whom have been tested out prior to hiring.  There is also the potential for improvement in development productivity and cost reduction in research and development. The intangible benefits include new ideas, fresh perspectives and experiences outside the corporate culture, early customer buy created by incorporating them in the development process, and a potential for increased accuracy for market research and customer targeting. Then, of course, it’s tough to estimate the time and energy lost by not partnering, especially when the competition is partnering. </p>\n",
      "<p>The hurdles in external collaboration are most typically in intellectual property management and licensing, but can also include areas from budgets to compliance to cultural clashes between the discovery driven institutions and deliverables driven corporations. Most hurdles are manageable with a little guidance and a clear definition of the roles, responsibilities and expectations. Be assured these partnerships happen all the time and corporations wouldn’t be investing 1-3% of their research and development budget if they weren’t fruitful. </p>\n",
      "<p>Here are some quick tips as you consider whether your technology research project or program is suitable for an external, collaborative partnership.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Know and leverage your strengths versus what you can obtain externally.</strong><br/>\n",
      "Corporations have the mission to sell as many products or services as they can and make money. Therefore, they tend to be experts on productization. That’s no simple feat when parts, chemistries, and technologies need to be scaled, efficient processes developed, and/or materials sourced, often in remote factories with cultural challenges to boot. Institutions (non-profits, government labs and Universities) have the mission to create new knowledge. </p>\n",
      "<p>Even though these entities have different missions, they can serve as valuable resources to each other because they are experts in different areas. Segment the work where each partner plays to their strengths: institutions handle more fundamental research and the corporation integrates the technology in-house with the full arsenal of information about the product, good or service. This effectively increases the corporations’ R&amp;D development effort and offers the institution a pathway to commercialization. Alternatively, corporations can partner with a university or government lab that has the technology of interest already partially developed on someone else’s dollar, increasing the corporation’s speed to market and reducing the overall cost of development.  Why should a corporation hire a group of highly skilled researchers for an area that is new or not core to their business until they have decided that this technology is a keeper? The risk goes against the mission of making money. </p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Know what to share. </strong><br/>\n",
      "Partnering doesn’t have to mean an open kimono. Remember, the mission of institutions is to disseminate the new knowledge developed during the partnering through teaching, publications, conference proceedings, graduate student defenses and/or patents. Confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements can work both ways with respect to managing sensitive information: they can foster open dialog or they can contaminate your internal efforts in a similar area. Choose wisely, and it is in the best interest of both parties to self sensor information that is not core to the project. See our post on Best Practices for Technology Partnership Collaboration Agreements. (link to other post)</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Align your expectations.</strong><br/>\n",
      "If you know going in that the expectations of your collaboration partner may differ from yours, then you can prepare for it. One of the first clashes in expectations may occur around timing of the project. The goal and timeline oriented industry culture versus the less structured and discovery-driven world of institutions can produce timeline friction. Most institutions are not equipped to work on products that are, or soon will be, in production, since they are juggling teaching assignments as well as research. So, plan around it. An efficient method of segmenting the work is to have the institution work on fundamental research that has a minimum timeline of 1-5 years. </p>\n",
      "<p>Another area to align expectations is how to deal with intellectual property ownership and licensing terms in any work between corporations and institutions.</p>\n",
      "<p>While corporations may be used to owning anything they pay for with their suppliers, this is not always possible in sponsored research projects with institutions. This is where an understanding of the goals and expectations and an experienced program manager can make sure that the needs of both parties are maintained. Corporations need to secure a competitive advantage, maintain the ability to make use or sell outcomes from the collaborative work and secure a licensing position in a specific market segment, while institutions need the ability to publish and continue research.</p>\n",
      "<p>Managing expectations and playing on each partners’ strengths is definitely the key to a successful collaborative partnership.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>What advice do you have for companies contemplating a collaborative technology partnership?</strong></p>\n",
